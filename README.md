# Information Flow and Decision-Making Simulation

This project is a modification based on UMich EECS281 Project2A. The page of original project: https://eecs281staff.github.io/p2-a-new-heap/ This project is to simulate the how the given information flow affects the decision making of multiple agents. 

## Details:

There are two opposite decisions: A and B. Multiple information sources influence multiple agents with evidence in favor of A or B. Each piece of information contains two features: priority (i.e., how "powerful" this piece is, which might be affected by which type of transmitter is used) and information intensity (i.e., how "many" words or figures are delivered).
